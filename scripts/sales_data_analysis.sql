   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   =============================================================================
   Script Purpose:
       This project performs an in-depth exploratory analysis of the Gold Layer 
       in a data warehouse modeled as a Star Schema. 
       The goal is to better understand data structure, quality, and business trends.

   The analysis includes:
       - Object exploration (tables, columns, data model validation)
       - Dimension exploration (customers, products, countries)
       - Measure exploration (sales, prices, quantities)
       - Magnitude analysis (aggregations by category, country, gender)
       - Ranking analysis (top and bottom customers, products, subcategories)
       - Data integrity checks (duplicates, missing values, unique keys)

   Business Purpose:
       To uncover actionable insights about customer behavior, sales performance, 
       and product contribution. 
       This analysis supports data-driven decision making and model validation 
       for downstream analytics and BI dashboards.

   Tools & Environment:
       - SQL (T-SQL)
       - Database: Gold Layer (Data Warehouse)
       - Schema Model: Star Schema (fact_sales, dim_customers, dim_products)

-- ===================================================================
-- OBJECTS EXPLORATION
-- ===================================================================
-- Explore all database objects to understand the structure of the schema
SELECT *
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
ORDER BY TABLE_SCHEMA;

-- Explore all columns in a specific table to get familiar with its attributes
SELECT *
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'dim_customers'; -- Get a sense of the tableâ€™s structure
-- Note: Useful for identifying column types, keys, and potential NULLs before analysis

-- ===================================================================
-- DIMENSIONS EXPLORATION
-- ===================================================================
-- Explore distinct customer countries to understand geographic distribution
SELECT DISTINCT
	country
FROM gold.dim_customers;

-- Explore product categories, subcategories, and names to understand hierarchy and diversity
SELECT DISTINCT
	category,
	subcategory_id,
	product_name
FROM gold.dim_products
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;
-- Note: Helps validate dimension completeness and check for missing or NULL categories

-- Analyze the range of order dates to understand data time coverage
SELECT
	MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date,
	MAX(order_date) AS last_order_date,
	DATEDIFF(year, MIN(order_date), MAX(order_date)) AS order_range_years,
	DATEDIFF(month, MIN(order_date), MAX(order_date)) AS order_range_months
FROM gold.fact_sales;
-- Note: Important for identifying the period over which the data spans and seasonality potential

-- Analyze customer age distribution and overall age range
SELECT
	MIN(birthdate) AS oldest_birthdate,
	DATEDIFF(year, MIN(birthdate), GETDATE()) AS oldest_age,
	MAX(birthdate) AS youngest_birthdate,
	DATEDIFF(year, MAX(birthdate), GETDATE()) AS youngest_age,
	DATEDIFF(year, MIN(birthdate), MAX(birthdate)) AS birthdate_range_years
FROM gold.dim_customers;
-- Note: Can reveal data entry errors and help segment customers by age

-- Note: Example to manually inspect detailed order data

-- Count total and distinct products to confirm product_key uniqueness
SELECT
	COUNT(product_key) AS total_products,

-- Count total and distinct customers who placed an order
SELECT
	COUNT(customer_key) AS total_customers,
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_key) AS total_customers_distinct 
FROM gold.fact_sales;
-- Note: Helps understand how many customers are active vs inactive

-- Generate a summary report that combines all main business KPIs (Key Performance Indicator)
